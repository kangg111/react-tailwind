## Getting Started with React

If you want to learn more about my development process or try out a project, here’s how you can run a React project locally:

### `1. Clone this repository:`

git clone [Repository URL]

### `2. Install dependencies:`

yarn install

### `3. Run the app locally:`

Visit http://localhost:3000 to view the app in your browser.
